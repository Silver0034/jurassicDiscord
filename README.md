# JurassicDiscord

A Jurassic World Fan Theme for BetterDiscord

## What is JurassicDiscord?

JurassicDiscord is a fan-made theme designed to work with the program [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/). It re-skins the application to look like it could have been used by the fictional Jurassic World amusement park.
